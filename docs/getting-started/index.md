# Quickstart

Before installing banco, take a look at the #Compatibility chart to make sure that your server software is supported.

## 1. Choosing the right version
Starting with version 0.3, banco is available in two different versions:

:fontawesome-solid-plus: **Modern** (PaperMC, PurpurMC, Pufferfish...): Compatible only with the latest Minecraft version

:fontawesome-solid-bucket: **Legacy** (Bukkit, SpigotMC): Supports the latest two major Minecraft versions (for example, Minecraft 1.20 and 1.21), but may not include all available features

## 2. Dependencies
- [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) 1.7+ or [VaultUnlocked](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vaultunlocked.117277/). Without the Vault API, banco will not do anything on its own

## 3. Installation
- Like any other plug-in, the downloaded jar file needs to be put in your server's `plugins/` folder
- Start your server at least once to generate a `settings.yml` file and download the required libraries

## 4. Add-ons (optional)
**banco** has some add-ons that expand on its features:
