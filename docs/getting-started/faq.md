# Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "When will banco be updated to support the latest version?"
    banco is an open-source project, so it depends entirely on its contributors. Unfortunately, it's impossible to give an ETA, but you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/bpkwdzREcR) to track progress and try experimental builds.

??? question "The plugin is not working and crashes almost immediately after starting the server"
    Please, make sure that you have installed [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/).

??? question "Where can I report bugs?"
    Please, before reporting any bugs, make sure that your server is running the latest version of banco. You can check it in-game with command `/banco`.

    If your server is updated you can report bugs [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/myth-MC/banco/issues) or [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/bpkwdzREcR).
